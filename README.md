# IOT-water-management-system

IOT water management system for IIIT-H done as a part of Usability Engineering course.

Today, the Internet of Things is associated with almost every luxury in our life ranging from 
smart cities to smart homes, traffic management system to transportation and various 
other fields. Thus we propose a model of using a smart water system in IIIT to help in the 
more efficient usage distribution and quality management of water services across 
campus.  

In the report, we have discussed the usability of our proposed system by analyzing its 
implementation in IIIT-H. That is, the system and the degree to which it can be used by itâ€™s 
users to achieve the goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.
